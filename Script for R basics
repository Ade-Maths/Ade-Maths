Introduction to working with R environment, it is crucial you start from here. You have to understand the working directory, you are working with.
Ensure you remember where you save your document of interest last. I get to always advice you save in documents, this is because often times than normal, the default working directory is set to be as documents

#########Set the Working Directory############

Before reading any data, you must enure that the file of interest is present or found in the R working directory.

setwd(“…”) will set the current working directory to a specific location
getwd() will print out the current directory.
> setwd("C:/mydata")

When specifying the pathname, R reads forward slashes, whereas Windows reads backward slashes. Setting the working directory can eliminate path confusion.


########Definition and Reading R Data Files#############

RData Files

Function: read.txt()  ....if in word format

Assign a simple name that could serve so easily to remember

AJana <- ("anatomy.txt")

Or

>  read.csv("anatomy.csv") for Excel files
